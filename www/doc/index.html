      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">To
	support anonymous course evaluations we will create a new package

	package.</P>

      <UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Assessmet
	    Package  allows to set an assessment as anonymous, this feature
	    works like this:  If the assessment is set as anonymous, the subject
	    associated with the session (generated result) will be the
	    unregistrated user. In our case, we want to store the user_id but
	    not show it on the browser. I think that  to  be able to set an
	    assessment as an anonymous evaluation ,and not as an anoymous
	    assessment, we have to add a column to the as_assessment s table or
	    create one table to map  the anonymous evaluations.
